<!- CSS Transforms ... exist as 2D and 3D transforms...
3D transforms are really cool... but we will focus on 2D transforms
based on their current compatibility.. -->

<!- A transform is an element that is rendered by CSS and rendered in 2 Dimensional space -->

<!-  In the follow lab... we will go through and create a small photo gallery... -->



<!- In the past when we wanted to use the header element we utilized something like this: <div id="header"... although now with html5 we have the "header" built in -->

<!- This built in style we accommodate h1-h6... althouh it can also hold other stuff too .. .like
search areas, logos, etc -->

<! but do not confuse header with the head -->


<!DOCTYPE html>


<html>

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>


<header>

<h1>My 2019 Art Gallery </h1>

<!- similar to past exercises... we will utilize an unordered list to link our images.. -->

</header>
